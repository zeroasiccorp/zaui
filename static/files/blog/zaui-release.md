# Zaui, our npm-installable SvelteKit toolchain

_Originally published at [https://www.zeroasic.com/blog/zaui-release](https://www.zeroasic.com/blog/zaui-release)._

We are pleased to announce the open source release of [zaui](https://github.com/zeroasiccorp/zaui), our npm-installable SvelteKit toolchain for building websites from markdown.

The name *zaui* originated from "Zero ASIC UI", where it powers the [zeroasic.com](https://www.zeroasic.com/) website.

### How we use zaui

Zaui was instrumental in shipping our [drag-and-drop chiplet emulation UI](https://www.zeroasic.com/emulation) using custom Svelte components. The zeroasic.com website is statically generated by zaui and hosted on a CDN. In addition, the build is integrated into our internal python-based emulation tools, which handle requests through an API.

### Quickstart

1. `pnpm install -D @zeroasic/zaui`
2. `pnpm zaui dev`
3. Type `o` to open your browser.

If you don't already have a `content` directory you will see the [zaui guide](https://zaui.zeroasic.com/guide/quickstart) -- rendered by zaui, of course.
