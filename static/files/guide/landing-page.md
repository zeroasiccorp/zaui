# Landing Page

The landing page design was inspired by [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) -- thank you Evan -- with a Hero section at the top and Feature boxes below that.

Use `hero` and `features` in your index.md frontmatter to configure each section. Icon configuration follows the same pattern as in the [menus](menus). Note that `hero` looks best combined with `fullwidth: true`, which allows the layout to take up the full width of the window, with no padding or margins.

Example from [here](https://github.com/zeroasiccorp/zaui/blob/main/static/files/index.md?plain=1).
